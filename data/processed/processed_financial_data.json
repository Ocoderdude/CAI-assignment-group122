(Nasdaq  RVSN)\n( Rail Vision  or the  Company ), an early commercialization stage technology company\nseeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today announced its\nfinancial results for the second half and full year ended December 31, 2024. The Company\nreported significant revenue growth and operational progress, strengthening its market\npresence in the U.S. and beyond.\n 2024 was a transformative year for Rail Vision,  said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision.\n Since the beginning of 2024, we ve secured over $34 million in funding, delivered key\norders to global industry leaders and strengthened our U.S. market presence. With\nexpanding fleet management, data services, and cloud integration, we are moving beyond\nhardware to a complete railway safety and analytics ecosystem. \nCommercial Execution\n  In early 2025, received a purchase order from a Central American freight operator for its MainLine system.\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\n  Completed in 2024 the first deliveries of MainLine systems related to a $1.4 million order from Israel Railways for ten Main\nLine Systems after successful evaluation,  marking the first-ever national rail installation of the Company s AI-based\ntech.\n  Completed multiple installations in 2024, including with a Class 1 U.S. freight operator, Loram, a top U.S. rail maintenance\nfirm, and a leading Latin American mining company.\n  Secured an initial $1 million order in January 2024 from a leading U.S.-based rail services company, followed by a\n$200,000 follow-on order in June 2024.\nGlobal Expansion\n  Entered the Indian market through a non-binding MOU with Sujan Ventures, targeting thousands of locomotives operated\nby Indian Railways.\n  Joined the MxV Rail Technology Roadmap Program under the American Association of Railroads to support safety and\nefficiency initiatives across North America.\nProduct Innovation\n  Launched an Active Control System enabling semi-autonomous train operation in collaboration with a U.S. rail company.\n  Introduced D.A.S.H., a proprietary SaaS platform delivering real-time operational insights and enhanced safety.\nMilestones and IP Protection\n  Gained regulatory approval from Israel Railways for its MainLine System, unlocking a $300,000 milestone payment.\n  Secured a U.S. patent and received a notice of allowance in Japan for its AI-powered obstacle detection system.\nFull Year 2024 Financial Results\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\n  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by 815% to $1.3 million, compared to $142,000 for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by installations for a leading global mining company that\npurchased a Rail Vision Main Line System, the first installation of Rail Vision s Main Line Systems for Israel Railways and\nthe successful delivery and installation of Rail Vision s Shunting Yard systems to Loram and a Class 1 US Railroad\ncompany.\n  Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased to $5,279,000 compared to\n$7,145,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and\nrelated personnel expenses due to a reduction in workforce, including a reduction in our employee base by 12 R D\nemployees, and a decrease in R D equipment purchases\n  General and administrative expenses totaled $4,175,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $4,339,000\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $164,000 or 3.7%. The decrease was primarily\nattributable to a decrease in salaries as part of the process of reducing costs and a decrease in share-based payment\nexpenses of grants which were fully vested or forfeited in 2024.\n  As a result of the foregoing, the Company s operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $9,004,000\ncompared to an operating loss of $11,403,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded expenses in amount of $20,181,000 due to the revaluation of\nderivatives and warrants liabilities in connection with warrants issued in a private placement and a convertible loan credit\nfacility that we entered into in January 2024 and an equity line facility that the Company established in October 2024. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, we did not incur any expenses related to revaluation of derivatives and warrants\nliabilities.\n  Other financial expenses amounted to $1,523,00 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $255,000 other\nfinancial income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the full amortization of\ndiscount related to a convertible loan credit facility that we entered into in January 2024 and set up fees of an equity line\nfacility that the Company established in October 2024.\n  GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $30,708,000, or $1.85 per ordinary share, compared to a\nGAAP net loss of $11,148,000, or $4.30 per ordinary share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n  Non-GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $10,129,000, or $0.61 per ordinary share, compared to a\nnon-GAAP net loss of $10,875,000, or $4.20 per ordinary share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\n  As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents rose to $17.5 million from $3.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe increase compared to December 31, 2023, is mainly due to the proceeds received from a private placement and\ncredit facility, from warrants exercised by shareholders and from issuance of shares under the equity line facility that the\nCompany established in October 2024, totaling $24.1 million gross ($23.9 net proceeds), less cash used during 2024.\nCash position and financing activities\n  Rail Vision secured during 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 over $34 million in gross proceeds to fuel its business\nthrough various financing transactions, including a private placement of its shares and warrants, exercises of warrants and\nusing its equity line facility.\n  In October 2024, the Company established an equity line facility, as amended in February 2025, pursuant to which it has\nthe right to sell up to $30.0 million of its ordinary shares, subject to certain limitations, from time to time during the 36-\nmonth period following the date of execution of the agreement. As of the date hereof, the Company has issued an\naggregate of 22,210,892 ordinary shares for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $18.3 million.\nSecond Half Financial Results\n  Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2024, were $539,000, compared to $142,000 for the six months ended\nDecember 31, 2023, representing an increase of 380%, mainly comprised from installation of Rail Vision s Main Line\nSystems for Israel Railways and the successful delivery and installation of Rail Vision s Shunting Yard systems to a Class\n1 US Railroad company.\n  Research and development expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2024, were $2,821,000, compared to\n$3,463,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 representing a decrease of 18%.

(Nasdaq  RVSN)\n( Rail Vision  or the  Company ), an early commercialization stage technology company\nseeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today announced its\nfinancial results for the second half and full year ended December 31, 2024. The Company\nreported significant revenue growth and operational progress, strengthening its market\npresence in the U.S. and beyond.\n 2024 was a transformative year for Rail Vision,  said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision.\n Since the beginning of 2024, we ve secured over $34 million in funding, delivered key\norders to global industry leaders and strengthened our U.S. market presence. With\nexpanding fleet management, data services, and cloud integration, we are moving beyond\nhardware to a complete railway safety and analytics ecosystem. \nCommercial Execution\n  In early 2025, received a purchase order from a Central American freight operator for its MainLine system.\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\n  Completed in 2024 the first deliveries of MainLine systems related to a $1.4 million order from Israel Railways for ten Main\nLine Systems after successful evaluation,  marking the first-ever national rail installation of the Company s AI-based\ntech.\n  Completed multiple installations in 2024, including with a Class 1 U.S. freight operator, Loram, a top U.S. rail maintenance\nfirm, and a leading Latin American mining company.\n  Secured an initial $1 million order in January 2024 from a leading U.S.-based rail services company, followed by a\n$200,000 follow-on order in June 2024.\nGlobal Expansion\n  Entered the Indian market through a non-binding MOU with Sujan Ventures, targeting thousands of locomotives operated\nby Indian Railways.\n  Joined the MxV Rail Technology Roadmap Program under the American Association of Railroads to support safety and\nefficiency initiatives across North America.\nProduct Innovation\n  Launched an Active Control System enabling semi-autonomous train operation in collaboration with a U.S. rail company.\n  Introduced D.A.S.H., a proprietary SaaS platform delivering real-time operational insights and enhanced safety.\nMilestones and IP Protection\n  Gained regulatory approval from Israel Railways for its MainLine System, unlocking a $300,000 milestone payment.\n  Secured a U.S. patent and received a notice of allowance in Japan for its AI-powered obstacle detection system.\nFull Year 2024 Financial Results\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\n  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by 815% to $1.3 million, compared to $142,000 for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by installations for a leading global mining company that\npurchased a Rail Vision Main Line System, the first installation of Rail Vision s Main Line Systems for Israel Railways and\nthe successful delivery and installation of Rail Vision s Shunting Yard systems to Loram and a Class 1 US Railroad\ncompany.\n  Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased to $5,279,000 compared to\n$7,145,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and\nrelated personnel expenses due to a reduction in workforce, including a reduction in our employee base by 12 R D\nemployees, and a decrease in R D equipment purchases\n  General and administrative expenses totaled $4,175,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $4,339,000\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $164,000 or 3.7%. The decrease was primarily\nattributable to a decrease in salaries as part of the process of reducing costs and a decrease in share-based payment\nexpenses of grants which were fully vested or forfeited in 2024.\n  As a result of the foregoing, the Company s operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $9,004,000\ncompared to an operating loss of $11,403,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded expenses in amount of $20,181,000 due to the revaluation of\nderivatives and warrants liabilities in connection with warrants issued in a private placement and a convertible loan credit\nfacility that we entered into in January 2024 and an equity line facility that the Company established in October 2024. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, we did not incur any expenses related to revaluation of derivatives and warrants\nliabilities.\n  Other financial expenses amounted to $1,523,00 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $255,000 other\nfinancial income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the full amortization of\ndiscount related to a convertible loan credit facility that we entered into in January 2024 and set up fees of an equity line\nfacility that the Company established in October 2024.\n  GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $30,708,000, or $1.85 per ordinary share, compared to a\nGAAP net loss of $11,148,000, or $4.30 per ordinary share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n  Non-GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $10,129,000, or $0.61 per ordinary share, compared to a\nnon-GAAP net loss of $10,875,000, or $4.20 per ordinary share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\n  As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents rose to $17.5 million from $3.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe increase compared to December 31, 2023, is mainly due to the proceeds received from a private placement and\ncredit facility, from warrants exercised by shareholders and from issuance of shares under the equity line facility that the\nCompany established in October 2024, totaling $24.1 million gross ($23.9 net proceeds), less cash used during 2024.\nCash position and financing activities\n  Rail Vision secured during 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 over $34 million in gross proceeds to fuel its business\nthrough various financing transactions, including a private placement of its shares and warrants, exercises of warrants and\nusing its equity line facility.\n  In October 2024, the Company established an equity line facility, as amended in February 2025, pursuant to which it has\nthe right to sell up to $30.0 million of its ordinary shares, subject to certain limitations, from time to time during the 36-\nmonth period following the date of execution of the agreement. As of the date hereof, the Company has issued an\naggregate of 22,210,892 ordinary shares for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $18.3 million.\nSecond Half Financial Results\n  Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2024, were $539,000, compared to $142,000 for the six months ended\nDecember 31, 2023, representing an increase of 380%, mainly comprised from installation of Rail Vision s Main Line\nSystems for Israel Railways and the successful delivery and installation of Rail Vision s Shunting Yard systems to a Class\n1 US Railroad company.\n  Research and development expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2024, were $2,821,000, compared to\n$3,463,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 representing a decrease of 18%.

(Nasdaq  RVSN)\n( Rail Vision  or the  Company ), a development stage technology company seeking to\nrevolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today reported financial results for\nthe second quarter ended June 30, 2022.\n Our transformational Nasdaq IPO closed in the first week of the second quarter, providing\nRail Vision with the capital needed to accelerate the commercial rollout of our game-\nchanging, artificial-intelligence-driven technology designed to revolutionize safety in the\nrail industry,  said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision.  With a strengthened balance sheet and\nincreased visibility as a Nasdaq-listed company, our team has continued to progress our\nlong-term pilot (LTP) programs with major rail operators. We have successfully completed\nmultiple LTPs that demonstrate the potential value of our technology, and we continue to\nlaunch new programs for additional use cases that we believe will become key growth\ndrivers moving forward as we convert LTPs into revenue-generating commercial contracts. \n As commercial sales of our AI-driven rail safety technology gain momentum, we generate\nan exponentially increasing amount of data, collected through our cloud infrastructure, that\nempowers our team to further refine our technology solutions while uncovering potential\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\nnew opportunities for growth,  continued Hania.  I remain extremely excited for the future\nand continue to believe Rail Vision is at the forefront of an evolution in train safety. \nSecond Quarter 2022   Recent Highlights\nRail Vision successfully completed the mainline LTP phase for Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO),\ndemonstrating 24 7 classifications of objects for RTIO s autonomous locomotives\noperating in the Australian desert.\nNegotiations are underway for the next steps in the Company s LTP programs with Israel\nRailways Ltd., the government-owned operator of the national heavy rail system in Israel,\nfollowing Rail Vision s successful completion of an LTP on Israel Railways  main-line\nsystem.\nCompleted the data acquisition phase for an advanced switch yard system for a major\nfreight railway operator in the United States, with plans underway to begin the\nevaluation and demonstration phase of the project.\nRail Vision closed its IPO on April 4, 2022, issuing 3,787,241 units. Each unit included one\nordinary share and a warrant to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $4.13.\nThe underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option with respect to 568,086\nwarrants to purchase ordinary shares. Gross proceeds for the o ering were\napproximately $15.6 million, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and\no ering expenses.\nSecond Quarter 2022 Financial Results\nResearch and development ( R D ) expenses, net for the three months ended June 30,\n2022, were $1,683,000, down moderately from $1,744,000 in the three months ended\nJune 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily related to a year-over-year decline in R D\nsta ng and a decrease in share-based compensation, partially o set by a one-time\npayment to Israel Railways of 1.5% of the net IPO proceeds. The Company anticipates\nR D expenses will increase in subsequent quarters as sta ng levels expand.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 were\n$1,315,000, compared to $842,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2021. The\nincrease is primarily a ributed to one-time IPO bonus payments to executive o cers,\nand an increase in professional services related to the Company being a public company\no set by a decrease in share-based compensation.\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\nNet loss for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $2,902,000, or $0.19 per\nordinary share, compared to a net loss of $2,160,000, or $0.24 per ordinary share, in the\nthree months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the net loss is a ributed mainly to the\nincrease in general and administrative expenses as detailed above.\nRail Vision ended the second quarter of 2022 with $12.9 million in cash and cash\nequivalents, compared to $1.6 million as of December 31, 2021.\nAbout Rail Vision Ltd.\nRail Vision is a development stage technology company that is seeking to revolutionize\nrailway safety and the data-related market.

(Nasdaq  RVSN)\n( Rail Vision  or the  Company ), a development stage technology company seeking to\nrevolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today reported financial results for\nthe second quarter ended June 30, 2022.\n Our transformational Nasdaq IPO closed in the first week of the second quarter, providing\nRail Vision with the capital needed to accelerate the commercial rollout of our game-\nchanging, artificial-intelligence-driven technology designed to revolutionize safety in the\nrail industry,  said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision.  With a strengthened balance sheet and\nincreased visibility as a Nasdaq-listed company, our team has continued to progress our\nlong-term pilot (LTP) programs with major rail operators. We have successfully completed\nmultiple LTPs that demonstrate the potential value of our technology, and we continue to\nlaunch new programs for additional use cases that we believe will become key growth\ndrivers moving forward as we convert LTPs into revenue-generating commercial contracts. \n As commercial sales of our AI-driven rail safety technology gain momentum, we generate\nan exponentially increasing amount of data, collected through our cloud infrastructure, that\nempowers our team to further refine our technology solutions while uncovering potential\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\nnew opportunities for growth,  continued Hania.  I remain extremely excited for the future\nand continue to believe Rail Vision is at the forefront of an evolution in train safety. \nSecond Quarter 2022   Recent Highlights\nRail Vision successfully completed the mainline LTP phase for Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO),\ndemonstrating 24 7 classifications of objects for RTIO s autonomous locomotives\noperating in the Australian desert.\nNegotiations are underway for the next steps in the Company s LTP programs with Israel\nRailways Ltd., the government-owned operator of the national heavy rail system in Israel,\nfollowing Rail Vision s successful completion of an LTP on Israel Railways  main-line\nsystem.\nCompleted the data acquisition phase for an advanced switch yard system for a major\nfreight railway operator in the United States, with plans underway to begin the\nevaluation and demonstration phase of the project.\nRail Vision closed its IPO on April 4, 2022, issuing 3,787,241 units. Each unit included one\nordinary share and a warrant to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $4.13.\nThe underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option with respect to 568,086\nwarrants to purchase ordinary shares. Gross proceeds for the o ering were\napproximately $15.6 million, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and\no ering expenses.\nSecond Quarter 2022 Financial Results\nResearch and development ( R D ) expenses, net for the three months ended June 30,\n2022, were $1,683,000, down moderately from $1,744,000 in the three months ended\nJune 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily related to a year-over-year decline in R D\nsta ng and a decrease in share-based compensation, partially o set by a one-time\npayment to Israel Railways of 1.5% of the net IPO proceeds. The Company anticipates\nR D expenses will increase in subsequent quarters as sta ng levels expand.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 were\n$1,315,000, compared to $842,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2021. The\nincrease is primarily a ributed to one-time IPO bonus payments to executive o cers,\nand an increase in professional services related to the Company being a public company\no set by a decrease in share-based compensation.\nExplore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF\nNet loss for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $2,902,000, or $0.19 per\nordinary share, compared to a net loss of $2,160,000, or $0.24 per ordinary share, in the\nthree months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the net loss is a ributed mainly to the\nincrease in general and administrative expenses as detailed above.\nRail Vision ended the second quarter of 2022 with $12.9 million in cash and cash\nequivalents, compared to $1.6 million as of December 31, 2021.\nAbout Rail Vision Ltd.\nRail Vision is a development stage technology company that is seeking to revolutionize\nrailway safety and the data-related market.
