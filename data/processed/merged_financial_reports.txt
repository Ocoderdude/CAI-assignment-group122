Rail Vision started 2024 by securing over $12 million in proceeds to fuel its business
through a pair of financing transactions, including a private placement of its shares and
warrants, a convertible loan credit facility and exercise of warrants.
Executing on sales

on orders with leading US-based rail and leasing services company  In April, Rail Vision
received an initial purchase order amounting to approximately $1 million as part of a

rail and leasing services company that the Company initially announced in January 2024.
In June 2024 Rail Vision received a follow-on order from the same customer, in the
amount of approximately $200,000, which is in addition to the original agreement and
refers to additional services requested by the customer.
Engaging with US and global industry leaders 
Rail Vision Successfully Installed its AI-Driven System for Class 1 US Operator  In June
2024, Rail Vision completed the successful installation of its AI-driven Shunting Yard
product for a Class 1 freight rail US-based company. The North American Class 1 rail

significant milestone in the Company s journey towards revolutionizing railway safety
and e ciency. A successful evaluation process resulted in the purchase of ten Rail
Vision Main Line Systems for $1.4 million by Israel Railways.
Strengthening IP protection 
In August 2024, Rail Vision was granted patent approval from the United States Patent and
Trademark O ce for its innovative AI-based railway obstacle detection system, which
followed the Company receiving a notice of allowance from the Japan Patent O ce for the
same patent application in June 2024.
First Half 2024 Financial Results
Revenues were $761,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, comprised from the
mining company that purchased a Rail Vision Main Line System, first installation of Rail
Vision s Main Line Systems in Israel Railways and the successful delivery and installation
of Rail Vision s Shunting Yard product to Loram.
Research and development ( R D ) expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024,
were $2,458,000, compared to R D expenses of $3,682,000 in the six months ended
June 30, 2023. The decrease in R D expenses was primarily a ributable to a decrease
in R D salaries due to a reduction in workforce, including a reduction in the Company
employee base by 12 R D employees and R D equipment purchases.
General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were
$2,116,000, compared to $2,303,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2023. The
decrease is primarily a ributed to a decrease in salaries and other administrative and
operational costs, as part of the process of reducing costs as mentioned above.
As a result of the foregoing, the Company s operating loss for the six months ended June
30, 2024, was $4,185,000 compared to an operating loss of $5,985,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2023.
Financial expenses amounted to $1,304,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a
decrease of $1,454,000, compared to $150,000 financial income for the six months
ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a ributable to the amortization of
discount related to a convertible loan credit facility that the Company entered into in
January 2024.
GAAP net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $24,324,000, or $1.99 per
ordinary share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $5,835,000, or $2.69 per ordinary

share, in the six months ended June 30, 2023.
Non-GAAP net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $5,394,000 or $0.44
per ordinary share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $5,671,000, or $2.62 per
ordinary share, in the six months ended June 30, 2023.

As of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $9.7 million, compared to $3.1
million as of December 31, 2023. The increase compared to December 31, 2023, is
mainly due to the proceeds received from a private placement and credit facility and
from warrants exercised by shareholders that occurred in the first half of 2024, totaling
$11.5 million gross ($11.3 net proceeds), less cash used during the first half of 2024.

Full Year 2024 Financial Results
Explore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF
  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by 815% to $1.3 million, compared to $142,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by installations for a leading global mining company that
purchased a Rail Vision Main Line System, the first installation of Rail Vision s Main Line Systems for Israel Railways and
the successful delivery and installation of Rail Vision s Shunting Yard systems to Loram and a Class 1 US Railroad
company.
  Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased to $5,279,000 compared to
$7,145,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and
related personnel expenses due to a reduction in workforce, including a reduction in our employee base by 12 R D
employees, and a decrease in R D equipment purchases
  General and administrative expenses totaled $4,175,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $4,339,000
for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $164,000 or 3.7%. The decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease in salaries as part of the process of reducing costs and a decrease in share-based payment
expenses of grants which were fully vested or forfeited in 2024.
  As a result of the foregoing, the Company s operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $9,004,000
compared to an operating loss of $11,403,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023.
  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded expenses in amount of $20,181,000 due to the revaluation of
derivatives and warrants liabilities in connection with warrants issued in a private placement and a convertible loan credit
facility that we entered into in January 2024 and an equity line facility that the Company established in October 2024. For
the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not incur any expenses related to revaluation of derivatives and warrants
liabilities.
  Other financial expenses amounted to $1,523,00 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $255,000 other
financial income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the full amortization of
discount related to a convertible loan credit facility that we entered into in January 2024 and set up fees of an equity line
facility that the Company established in October 2024.
  GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $30,708,000, or $1.85 per ordinary share, compared to a
GAAP net loss of $11,148,000, or $4.30 per ordinary share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.
  Non-GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $10,129,000, or $0.61 per ordinary share, compared to a
non-GAAP net loss of $10,875,000, or $4.20 per ordinary share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.
Balance Sheet Highlights
Explore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF
  As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents rose to $17.5 million from $3.3 million as of December 31, 2023.
The increase compared to December 31, 2023, is mainly due to the proceeds received from a private placement and
credit facility, from warrants exercised by shareholders and from issuance of shares under the equity line facility that the
Company established in October 2024, totaling $24.1 million gross ($23.9 net proceeds), less cash used during 2024.
Cash position and financing activities
  Rail Vision secured during 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 over $34 million in gross proceeds to fuel its business
through various financing transactions, including a private placement of its shares and warrants, exercises of warrants and
using its equity line facility.
  In October 2024, the Company established an equity line facility, as amended in February 2025, pursuant to which it has
the right to sell up to $30.0 million of its ordinary shares, subject to certain limitations, from time to time during the 36-
month period following the date of execution of the agreement. As of the date hereof, the Company has issued an
aggregate of 22,210,892 ordinary shares for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $18.3 million.
Second Half Financial Results
  Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2024, were $539,000, compared to $142,000 for the six months ended
December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 380%, mainly comprised from installation of Rail Vision s Main Line
Systems for Israel Railways and the successful delivery and installation of Rail Vision s Shunting Yard systems to a Class
1 US Railroad company.
  Research and development expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2024, were $2,821,000, compared to
$3,463,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 representing a decrease of 18%. The decrease in R D
expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in R D salaries due to a reduction in the Company employee base by
12 R D employees.
  General and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2024, were $2,059,000, similar to
$2,036,000 in the six months ended December 31, 2023.
  As a result of the foregoing, the Company s operating loss for the six months ended December 31, 2024, was $4,819,000
compared to an operating loss of $5,418,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023.

  For the six months ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded expenses in amount of $1,346,000 due to the
revaluation of derivatives and warrants liabilities in connection with the equity line facility that the Company established in
October 2024. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, we did not incur any expenses related to revaluation of
derivatives and warrants liabilities.
  Financial expenses amounted to $219,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2024, compared to $155,000 financial
income for the six months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to set up fees related to the
equity line facility that the Company established in October 2024.
  GAAP net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2024, was $6,384,000, or $0.30 per ordinary share, compared to a
GAAP net loss of $5,313,000, or $1.77 per ordinary share, in the six months ended December 31, 2023.
  Non-GAAP net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2024, was $4,736,000 or $0.23 per ordinary share, compared
to a non-GAAP net loss of $5,204,000, or $1.74 per ordinary share, in the six months ended December 31, 2023.
A copy of Rail Vision s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2024

company s management believes the non-GAAP financial information provided in this

with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated.
Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the
reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S.

Release Details
Rail Vision Announces First Quarter 2022 Financial
Results
July 6, 2022
 
PDF Version
RA ANANA, Israel, July 06, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rail Vision Ltd. (Nasdaq  RVSN)
( Rail Vision  or the  Company ), a development stage technology company seeking to
revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today reported financial results for
the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.
 The first quarter of 2022 was a truly transformational period for Rail Vision that culminated
with our Nasdaq IPO, which provided us with critical funding to accelerate the commercial
rollout of our game-changing, artificial-intelligence-driven technology for the rail industry, 
said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision.  I am tremendously proud of the work our team has
accomplished in strengthening our foundation for future successes. The results from
multiple LTPs underway, nearing completion, and even completed, for major potential
customers gives us strong confidence in the potential for our technology to ultimately make
a significant impact on rail safety globally. 
 As we continue to execute LTPs and begin delivering commercial systems to customers,
our team is collecting important data through our cloud infrastructure that empowers
further refinement of current systems while uncovering potential new opportunities for
Explore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF
growth,  continued Hania.  I am extremely excited for the future and believe Rail Vision is at
the forefront of an evolution in train safety. 
First Quarter 2022   Recent Highlights
Delivered a main-line system to Hitachi Rail Australia for long-term pilot ( LTP ) with Rio
Tinto Iron Ore ( RTIO ), the world s second-largest metals and mining company. Rail
Vision s main-line system was installed on RTIO s autonomous locomotives, and the LTP
is underway as scheduled and is expected to continue through the end of July 2022.
RTIO is also evaluating further use cases that may expand the LTP and include additional
testing programs throughout the second half of 2022.
Completed a four-month LTP of Rail Vision s main-line system with Israel Railways Ltd.,
the government-owned operator of the national heavy rail system in Israel. Israel
Railways is currently evaluating the main-line system for freight locomotives.
Completed the data acquisition phase and executed a successful demo of the
Company s advanced automated monitoring system for a US-based railway
infrastructure and maintenance company. Negotiations for the next stage of
development and delivery of systems is now underway.
Rail Vision s ordinary shares and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market
on March 31, 2022, under the symbols  RVSN  and  RVSNW,  respectively. On April 4,
2022, the Company closed its IPO, in which the Company issued 3,787,241 units. Each
unit included one ordinary share and a warrant to purchase one ordinary share at an
exercise price of $4.13. Gross proceeds for the o ering were approximately $15.6 million,
before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and estimated o ering
expenses. As this o ering closed subsequent to quarter end, the proceeds from the
o ering are not reflected on the Company s financial statements for the first quarter of
2022.
First Quarter 2022 Financial Results
Research and development ( R D ) expenses, net for the three months ended March 31,
2022 were $1,423,000 compared to $2,094,000 in the three months ended March 31,
2021. The decrease is primarily related to a year-over-year decline in R D sta ng and a
decrease in share-based compensation . The Company anticipates R D expenses will
increase in subsequent quarters as sta ng levels expand.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2022 were
$813,000 compared to $885,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The
decrease is primarily a ributed to a decrease in share-based compensation o set by an
increase in professional services related to the Company being a public company.
Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $2,346,000, or $0.26 per
ordinary share, compared to a net loss of $2,968,000, or $0.32 per ordinary share, in the
three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in the net loss is a ributed mainly to
the decrease in R D and share-based compensation expenses as detailed above.
Rail Vision ended the first quarter of 2022 with $2.2 million in cash and cash
equivalents.

Rail Vision Announces Second Quarter 2022 Financial
Results
September 14, 2022
 
PDF Version
RA ANANA, Israel, Sept. 14, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rail Vision Ltd. (Nasdaq  RVSN)
( Rail Vision  or the  Company ), a development stage technology company seeking to
revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today reported financial results for
the second quarter ended June 30, 2022.
 Our transformational Nasdaq IPO closed in the first week of the second quarter, providing
Rail Vision with the capital needed to accelerate the commercial rollout of our game-
changing, artificial-intelligence-driven technology designed to revolutionize safety in the
rail industry,  said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision.  With a strengthened balance sheet and
increased visibility as a Nasdaq-listed company, our team has continued to progress our
long-term pilot (LTP) programs with major rail operators. We have successfully completed
multiple LTPs that demonstrate the potential value of our technology, and we continue to
launch new programs for additional use cases that we believe will become key growth
drivers moving forward as we convert LTPs into revenue-generating commercial contracts. 
 As commercial sales of our AI-driven rail safety technology gain momentum, we generate
an exponentially increasing amount of data, collected through our cloud infrastructure, that
empowers our team to further refine our technology solutions while uncovering potential
Explore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF
new opportunities for growth,  continued Hania.  I remain extremely excited for the future
and continue to believe Rail Vision is at the forefront of an evolution in train safety. 
Second Quarter 2022   Recent Highlights
Rail Vision successfully completed the mainline LTP phase for Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO),
demonstrating 24 7 classifications of objects for RTIO s autonomous locomotives
operating in the Australian desert.
Negotiations are underway for the next steps in the Company s LTP programs with Israel
Railways Ltd., the government-owned operator of the national heavy rail system in Israel,
following Rail Vision s successful completion of an LTP on Israel Railways  main-line
system.
Completed the data acquisition phase for an advanced switch yard system for a major
freight railway operator in the United States, with plans underway to begin the
evaluation and demonstration phase of the project.
Rail Vision closed its IPO on April 4, 2022, issuing 3,787,241 units. Each unit included one
ordinary share and a warrant to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $4.13.
The underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option with respect to 568,086
warrants to purchase ordinary shares. Gross proceeds for the o ering were
approximately $15.6 million, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and
o ering expenses.
Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results
Research and development ( R D ) expenses, net for the three months ended June 30,
2022, were $1,683,000, down moderately from $1,744,000 in the three months ended
June 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily related to a year-over-year decline in R D
sta ng and a decrease in share-based compensation, partially o set by a one-time
payment to Israel Railways of 1.5% of the net IPO proceeds. The Company anticipates
R D expenses will increase in subsequent quarters as sta ng levels expand.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 were
$1,315,000, compared to $842,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2021. The
increase is primarily a ributed to one-time IPO bonus payments to executive o cers,
and an increase in professional services related to the Company being a public company
o set by a decrease in share-based compensation.
Explore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF
Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $2,902,000, or $0.19 per
ordinary share, compared to a net loss of $2,160,000, or $0.24 per ordinary share, in the
three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the net loss is a ributed mainly to the
increase in general and administrative expenses as detailed above.
Rail Vision ended the second quarter of 2022 with $12.9 million in cash and cash
equivalents, compared to $1.6 million as of December 31, 2021.

Release Details
Rail Vision Announces Third Quarter 2023 Financial
Results
November 24, 2023
 
PDF Version
RA ANANA, Israel, Nov. 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rail Vision Ltd. (Nasdaq  RVSN)
( Rail Vision  or the  Company ), a development stage technology company seeking to
revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today reported financial results for
the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.
Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision, stated,  I would like to begin by expressing our hear elt
sympathies and condolences to all those who have been a ected by the recent tragic
events in Israel. Despite the di cult circumstances in our home country, I want to reassure
our shareholders and stakeholders that Rail Vision s operations continue unabated. Our
commitment to delivering innovative, safety-enhancing technology to the global rail
industry remains as strong as ever. 
 We reached another significant milestone in the third quarter with the successful
completion of a pilot program with a leading US-based rail and leasing services company.
This customer purchased one of our Switch Yard Systems this year and has been impressed
with the results on extensive testing. We are now discussing plans with this customer to
implement our technology on additional locomotives beginning as soon as Q4 2023. This is
Explore our developer-friendly HTML to PDF API Printed using PDFCrowd HTML to PDF
a testament to the reliability and e ectiveness of our solutions in improving safety and
e ciency in rail operations,  continued Hania.
 In addition, we recently expanded our global footprint with a $500,000 purchase order
from a leading Latin American mining company received in October 2023,  said Hania.  This
contract demonstrates the trust that a growing number of customers worldwide place in
our technology solutions. This new customer purchased a Main Line Advance Driver
Assistance System (ADAS), equipped with high-end electro-optical sensors, machine
learning algorithms and edge computing capabilities. Our ADAS solution provides operators
with accurate and timely information, enabling them to make informed decisions and
enhance the safety of train operations.
 As we move forward, we remain steadfast in our mission  to leverage advanced technology
to make railways safer and more e cient. This belief drives every decision we make at Rail
Vision, and we are commi ed to continuing to execute on this vision for the benefit of our
customers, shareholders and stakeholders worldwide,  concluded Hania.
Third Quarter 2023   Recent Highlights
In October 2023, the Company received a purchase order in the amount of
approximately $500,000 for a Main Line ADAS system and related services from a
leading Latin American (LATAM) mining company. This Main Line ADAS system is
expected to be delivered to the new customer during the fourth quarter of 2023. The
LATAM mining company will benefit from Rail Vision s robust Main Line ADAS system
which uses high-end electro-optical sensors, machine learning algorithms, and edge
computing capabilities to improve the safety of train operations by providing operators
with accurate and timely information to make informed decisions. Rail Vision will also
provide supervision, guidance, and training services as part of the purchase order. This
comprehensive approach ensures that the Main Line ADAS system is seamlessly
integrated into the customer s existing infrastructure and operations, minimizing
disruption and downtime during implementation.
A trial was completed for a leading US-based rail and leasing services company that
purchased a Rail Vision Switch Yard System during 2023. This new customer, which
o ers a suite of rail-centric services, including in-plant rail switching and material

handling services, is expected to begin implementing Rail Vision s technology on
additional locomotives during Q4 2023.

at the ratio of 1-for-8, such that each eight (8) ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.01 per
share, were consolidated into one (1) ordinary share, par value NIS 0.08. All references to
share and per share amounts referred to herein reflect the reverse share split.

Revenues were $142,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to

primarily driven by a US-based rail and leasing services company that purchased a Rail
Vision Switch Yard System during Q1 2023 and completed its evaluation during Q3
2023.

 In 2023, while we faced challenges and were presented with new business opportunities,
it was a year marked by significant progress and milestones for Rail Vision. We sold our first

cash position, enabling us to execute our business plans,  commented Shahar Hania, CEO of

Company raised an additional approximately $5.2 million upon the exercise of warrants.
In January 2024, Rail Vision signed a supply contract with leading US-based rail and
